# Facility Fit: Maintenance

**Facility Fit: Maintenance** is an enterprise mobile application that empowers healthcare facility teams to manage work orders, track assets, and maintain compliance in critical medical environments.

---

## 🔹 Leadership & Project Overview

Facility Fit: Maintenance replaced an aging Cordova/Kendo UI app with a fully native Xamarin.Forms solution. As the sole mobile developer, I led the rebuild from the ground up — delivering a robust offline experience, dynamic asset tracking, and regulatory compliance features such as an EULA acceptance flow. I shaped the app’s workflows directly with Aramark’s operations teams, ensuring it solved real on-site challenges for maintenance and engineering staff.

## 🧑‍💼 My Role

As the **Mobile Architect and Lead Developer**, I:
- Rebuilt the full mobile application from scratch using Xamarin.Forms.
- Designed offline-first architecture for work requests and asset management.
- Integrated barcode scanning and dynamic search filters for field asset lookups.
- Implemented a time & wage tracking module for labor reporting.
- Added a legally compliant EULA flow tied to login and environment switching.
- Led direct collaboration with stakeholders to match live work order needs.
