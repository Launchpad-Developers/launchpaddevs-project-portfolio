# Workout Tracking

**Workout Tracking** is a cross-platform fitness app designed to help users log, monitor, and analyze their strength training exercises and routines. The app provides an intuitive interface for tracking sets, reps, weights, and workout history, along with detailed exercise descriptions and progress graphs.

Built with **.NET MAUI**, the app delivers a seamless experience on iOS (currently available on the App Store) and was formerly supported on Android. It emphasizes ease of use, rich exercise data management, and progress visualization for fitness enthusiasts of all levels.

This project was **solely designed and developed** by me under **Launchpad Developers Inc**, with the complete source code included in this repository.
