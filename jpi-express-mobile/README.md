# JPI Express Mobile

**JPI Express Mobile** is an internal operations app for field crews and project managers. It streamlines daily tasks such as work order management, inventory tracking, material requests, calendar scheduling, and secure field signatures — all from a single mobile platform.

Built with **Xamarin.Forms** for iOS and Android, the project emphasizes offline-first reliability, easy authentication with Microsoft SSO, and a field-friendly user interface.

This was delivered as a high-impact enterprise tool under **Launchpad Developers Inc.**, demonstrating my direct leadership and technical execution in mobile development for operational efficiency.
