# Facility Fit: Inspections

**Facility Fit: Inspections** is a dynamic mobile app used by healthcare engineering and safety teams to manage on-site inspections and compliance reporting. Designed for flexibility and multi-campus support, the app uses XML-driven workflows, advanced filtering, and integrated barcode scanning to streamline field inspections in challenging environments.

---

## 🔹 Leadership & Project Overview

Facility Fit: Inspections replaced an outdated Cordova-based solution with a modern Xamarin.Forms app that is resilient, maintainable, and highly adaptable. I led the architecture and development from the ground up — transforming legacy JavaScript logic into a fully native experience, adding robust offline support, and integrating scanning capabilities for faster field operations.

## 🧑‍💼 My Role

As the **Mobile Architect and Lead Developer**, I:
- Designed and built the dynamic inspection engine using XML decision trees.
- Developed flexible search, filtering, and scan workflows.
- Integrated a QR/barcode scanning module for real-time asset lookups.
- Implemented multi-campus and environment switching.
- Ensured offline mode for inspections in low-connectivity areas.
- Aligned UI/UX with the broader Facility Fit suite for consistent branding.
