# Into His Marvelous Light (IHML)

**Into His Marvelous Light** is a multi-language interactive Bible study app built for broad global reach. It guides users through scripture with dynamic highlights, cross-references, and modern reading plans — all updated in real time without requiring app store updates.

Originally built with **Xamarin.Forms** and later migrated to **.NET MAUI**, this project leverages Google Firebase Realtime Database to deliver multilingual content dynamically. This lets the publisher push new translations instantly — every user’s local database auto-refreshes when the app detects a newer version.

This was a personal passion project: a collaboration between the publisher and myself to make life-changing study material accessible to anyone, anywhere.
