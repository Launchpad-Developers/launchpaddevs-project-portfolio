# Only One Name

**Only One Name** is an interactive Bible study app designed to reach diverse global audiences through **Parallel Learning** — allowing two languages to appear side-by-side, including full right-to-left script support. This unique feature helps teachers and students follow along together, no matter their native tongue.

Built originally with **Xamarin.Forms** and later migrated to **.NET MAUI**, the app uses **Google Firebase Realtime Database** to deliver lesson content dynamically. Publishers can add new languages instantly without forcing users to update from the store — the local database refreshes itself automatically when a new version is published.

This project was a passion collaboration between the Bible study author and myself, driven by a mission to make this message more accessible worldwide.
