# Facility Fit: Assignments

**Facility Fit: Assignments** is an enterprise mobile app for managing patient room assignments and cleaning workflows inside large medical facilities. The app supports HIPAA-compliant data flows, offline sync, multi-step task handling, and dynamic infection control logic.

As the sole mobile engineer, I rebuilt Assignments from scratch, modernizing the legacy Cordova/Kendo UI solution into a robust Xamarin.Forms app. The original JavaScript served only as a rough reference for APIs and workflows ‚Äî every feature was rebuilt by hand for performance and maintainability.

## üìå **Key Highlights**
- Complete ownership of mobile design, architecture, and delivery.
- Built robust offline sync for patient room transfers and task status updates.
- Integrated real-time status tracking for assignments (*Not Started, In Progress, Delayed, Complete*).
- Implemented dynamic cleaning workflows for infection control (e.g., *MRSA*, *BLEACH C DIFF*).
- Added secure login with flexible server switching for multiple staging/prod environments.
- Developed in-app version check logic to manage enterprise-wide app updates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Details**
- Xamarin.Forms + Prism.Forms (MVVM)
