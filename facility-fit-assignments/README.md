# Facility Fit: Assignments

**Facility Fit: Assignments** is an enterprise mobile app for managing patient room assignments and cleaning workflows in large medical facilities. The app supports HIPAA-compliant data flows, offline sync, dynamic cleaning types (like MRSA protocols), timers, and multi-state task workflows ‚Äî all designed for real-world use by hospital staff.

---

## üîπ Leadership & Project Overview

Facility Fit: Assignments is part of a larger suite of Facility Fit mobile apps. This project involved replacing a discontinued Cordova/Kendo UI solution with a robust, future-ready Xamarin.Forms build. I led every aspect of the rebuild ‚Äî from initial architecture to field deployment ‚Äî working directly with Aramark‚Äôs operations team to ensure the app matched real-world workflows and strict regulatory standards.

## üßë‚Äçüíº My Role

As the **Mobile Architect and Lead Developer**, I:
- Rebuilt the entire mobile app from scratch, referencing the legacy JavaScript only for API logic.
- Designed the offline-first data layer and sync routines.
- Implemented dynamic status tracking for assignments (*Not Started, In Progress, Delayed, Complete*).
- Integrated secure authentication and flexible server switching to support multiple staging/production environments.
- Added version check logic for proactive enterprise updates.
- Worked closely with stakeholders and field testers to refine usability.

## üß≠ Leadership Principles in Action

- **Ownership:** Took full responsibility for design, architecture, development, and deployment.
- **Customer Obsession:** Field-tested with real healthcare staff to match the cleaning workflow exactly.
- **Security & Compliance:** Ensured HIPAA requirements were met with secure auth and offline storage.
- **Bias for Action:** Delivered on tight deadlines to replace legacy apps before third-party support expired.
- **Operational Excellence:** Added version control prompts and environment switches to reduce rollout risk.

## üöÄ Key Capabilities

- HIPAA-compliant patient transfer and cleaning assignments.
- Offline sync for tasks, timers, and user actions.
- Dynamic cleaning workflows (e.g., *MRSA*, *BLEACH C DIFF*, UV sanitization).
- Multi-step status tracking: Begin, Delay, Complete.
- In-app version update checks.
- Secure login and server switching for staging/prod.
