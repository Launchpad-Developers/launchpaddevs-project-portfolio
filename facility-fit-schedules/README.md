# Facility Fit: eScheduler

**Facility Fit: eScheduler** is an advanced scheduling tool that extends the capabilities of Assignments by adding robust scheduling workflows and real-time coordination for patient transfers and service tasks.

I built eScheduler as a **net-new** app during the Facility Fit rollout. I owned all mobile development and collaborated closely with Aramark’s design, QA, and field teams from concept to deployment.
