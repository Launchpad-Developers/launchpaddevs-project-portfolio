# Participant Mobile (Wellview / First Stop Health)

**Participant Mobile** is a secure, employer-sponsored mobile health platform originally branded as Wellview and now operating under **First Stop Health**. It empowers users to manage appointments, connect with care teams, track lab work, and access personalized wellness resources ‚Äî all from a single, HIPAA-compliant app.

I developed this app using **Xamarin.Native** (**Xamarin.iOS** and **Xamarin.Android**) to ensure smooth, native experiences across both platforms. It includes dynamic account setup flows, secure authentication, and robust integrations with Wellview‚Äôs backend health management system.
